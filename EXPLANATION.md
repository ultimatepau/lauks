# Explanation

## Why ?
If you ask me why i'm create single page model with modal form because its easier to understand than moving betweens page for operation data like creating or updating so i'm go with modals for Create, Update and Delete.
<br><br>
For displaying data i'm use data table because its common for CMS in every application, it has feature like sort and pagination.
<br><br>
I'm implement global search too so user can easily for finding data in every cell, no need to per-column sort
<br><br>
Last but not least i implement PWA too, so user can install the app in their devices, no need to open browser and typing manual the url.
<br><br>
ps: I'm implement the json-reactform too as your wish.
